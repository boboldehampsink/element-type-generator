# DEPRECATED - Element Type Generator
A CLI script that generates Element Types

## Deprecated
With the release of Craft 3 on 4-4-2018, this tool has been deprecated. You can still use this with Craft 2 but you are encouraged to use (and develop) a Craft 3 version. At this moment, I have no plans to do so.

4. Destination

## Changelog
### 0.2
